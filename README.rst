 HTML Tree-sitter mode for Emacs
=================================

A simple tree-sitter major mode for HTML and Emacs 29.

**NOTE**: Please make sure you're using the tagged release ``v0.20.1``. `Direct link to it here<https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-html/releases/tag/v0.20.1>`__. The grammar has changed substantially in the last couple of months, and the code in this repository reflects that.

It's a meant to demonstrate -- though it works well -- how to write your own tree-sitter-enabled major modes.

`My article on writing this major mode <https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/lets-write-a-treesitter-major-mode>`__ should help you write your own tree-sitter enabled major mode.
